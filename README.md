##NOOBjs Funk

NOOBjs Funk is a utility library that takes all of the functionality of Underscore.js and tries to dumb down the code so that the noob can really understand what's going on under the hood.

NOOBjs Funk is not as performant as Underscore or Lo-Dash and should not be used in production, but it is hopefully more readable.


Acknowledgements: Thanks to all of the contributors to Underscore. A lot of this code came from the Underscore source code, and the goal is that you'd be able to replaced NOOBjs Funk with Underscore if your site went into production.
