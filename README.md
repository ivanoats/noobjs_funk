##NOOBjs Funk

NOOBjs Funk is a utility library that takes all of the functionality of Underscore.js and tries to dumb down the code so that the noob can really understand what's going on under the hood.

NOOBjs Funk is not as performant as Underscore or Lo-Dash and should not be used in production, but it is hopefully more readable.
